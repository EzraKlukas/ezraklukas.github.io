title: Robot Summer 2025 (ENPH 253)
description: Each summer, sixty second year UBC engineering physics students get the privilege to bunker down in a specialized workshop custom built for the summer. The goal is, from scratch, to design, prototype, and build a fully autonomous robot to traverse a challenging course, detect and pick up magnet-inserted stuffed pets, and return them to a home zone.
skills: 
  - CAD, waterjet, laserjet, 3D printing
  - Handtool and machine prototyping - 
  - Breadboard circuit design and troubleshooting
  - KiCAD Schematic and PCB design
  - ESP32 microcontroller
  - Datasheet traversal for IC use in circuit design
