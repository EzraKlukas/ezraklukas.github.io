title: ENPH259 Motor Control Circuit
description: This circuit was the final project for a second year introductory experimental techniques course. The overarching purpose of the circuit is to make a motor spin at a desired speed. This entails a tunable frequency parameter and a control loop to make constant adjustments to maintain the speed of the motor.
skills: 
  - Breadboard circuit design
  - DMM debugging
  - Oscilloscope
  - Logic analyzer
  - Linear Circuit analysis

# Assembly, Debugging, Lessons learned
Talk about some of the skills I learned - logic analyzer, intuition behind planning how I layed out my breadboard to make troubleshooting easier, difficulties I encountered / would do differently next time, and so on.
Maybe show some samples of how I went about troubleshooting, or not, maybe that can be something I just point to the report in, but I can talk meta about it none-the-less, and how that was one of the main pros of the course.


### Embed images - use, for example to show the schematic...
{% include image-gallery.html images="project2.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.
